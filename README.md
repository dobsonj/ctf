# CTF
Tools and writeups for various capture-the-flag events. These challenges are a great way to learn about reverse engineering, cryptography, vulnerability discovery, and exploit development. It also happens to be a great way to find out what you _don't_ know!

Some of these are just for solo practice, but the real events are with [burner_herz0g](https://ctftime.org/team/63292). There's going to be a lot of unfinished stuff in this repo just because it might be useful for another challenge later on. This is an evolving record of my progress as I gain experience and learn more tools of the trade. So much to learn, so little time.
