# ctf
Tools and writeups for various capture-the-flag events.

Some of these are just for solo practice, but the real events are with a team ([burner_herz0g](https://ctftime.org/team/63292)). There's going to be lots of unfinished stuff in this repo just because it might be useful for something else later.
