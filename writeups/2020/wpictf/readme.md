# Summary

I focused most of my time on the following 3 challenges:

## Reverse Engineering

* [danger-Live-and-Malicious-Code](danger-Live-and-Malicious-Code/)
* [NotWannasigh](NotWannasigh/)

## Cryptography

* [acurless_kdf](acurless_kdf/) (INCOMPLETE)

I completed the first two and ran out of time on acurless_kdf. But apparently no one else got that one either.

# Ranking
We placed *4th* out of 925 registered teams and 619 scoring teams (>=25 pts).
