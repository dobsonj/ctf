## Description

```
Having a non-weak seed when generating "random" numbers is super important! Can you figure out what is wrong with this PRNG implementation?

seed.py is the Python script used to generate the flag for this challenge. log.txt is the output from the script when the flag was generated.

What is the flag?
```

Downloads: `seed.py` `log.txt`

## Analysis

`seed.py` generated the flag by creating a bunch of sha256 hashes in a loop and then writing out the one with `b9ff3ebf` in the string as the flag:

```python3
def seed():
    return round(time.time())

def hash(text):
    return hashlib.sha256(str(text).encode()).hexdigest()

def main():
    while True:
        s = seed()
        random.seed(s, version=2)

        x = random.random()
        flag = hash(x)

        if 'b9ff3ebf' in flag:
            with open("./flag", "w") as f:
                f.write(f"dam{{{flag}}}")
            f.close()
            break

        print(f"Incorrect: {x}")
    print("Good job <3")

if __name__ == "__main__":
   sys.exit(main())
```

This is what happened when the author ran the script:

```
$ cat log.txt

Good job <3
```

The problem with this, is the seed is based on time and rounded to the nearest integer:

```python3
def seed():
    return round(time.time())
```

## Solution

Since our current time is later than when the author ran it, we just have to make a minor change to that script to start the seed with the current time, and decrement the seed each iteration until we find one that generates the flag:

```
$ diff seed.py solve.py
14,15c14,16
<     while True:
<         s = seed()
---
>     s = seed()
>     while s > 0:
>         s = s - 1
```

```
$ python3 ./solve.py
...
$ cat flag 
dam{f6f73f022249b67e0ff840c8635d95812bbb5437170464863eda8ba2b9ff3ebf}
```
