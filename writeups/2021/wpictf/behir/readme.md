## Description

```
The information stealer Behir.py ate everything - including the flag. It should be somewhere in the malware. Be careful though, it's still a dangerous monster.

*Important note: In its default state, the script is "defanged" and shouldn't exfiltrate any stolen information. However, this can easily be changed and you may accidentally harm your computer while solving the challenge. PLEASE make sure that you run this malware in a virtual machine/isolated lab/sandboxed enviornment. The sample file is stored in an encrypted zip with the password "infected".
